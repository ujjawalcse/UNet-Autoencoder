# UNet-Autoencoder
In this repository i have implemented UNet autoencoder.
Dataset used here is private ( images used here are cloths images)
you can see the result in the notebook itself.
Also you can save the bottleneck of the autoencoder that can act as compressed feature.
I have used this bottleneck weight to identify similar types of cloths.
